	DaleMUD is actually modified SillyMUD which was modified 
	Diku code.


Now that that is all cleared up.... Just a few notes

	If you do not like AD&D then I would stop reading here and rm all
the Dale files, because I tried to base all the features I added (as well
did John in SillyMUD) to use the AD&D rules. I personally enjoy they game so
that is my choice.

	I make no claims that I am a good programmer so if things look bad
either I didn't do it or I was sleepy that day ;-). Most of the coding was
already there for me to use. Further I do not want any claims to copyrights
nor anything near it... simply, I want you to have what I had when I started
mudding... good code. I try and catch all bugs but that does not mean there
might not be one or two. If you DO find a bug and fix it please let me know
about it so I can correct the code I will distribute.


Few things that need to be added are paladin/psi/ranger special procedures
(like the magic_user and druid() functions).

Hope you enjoy this code, John did a wonderful job as well as the original
Diku coders, hope I can keep it looking as good.

Special thanks go to jcy, the guy that helped me find some of the hardest
bugs!

Version 3.0

	Addtional coder that helped alot this edition is Denis Julitov, r
better know as Aarcerak.

	Major contributors to the world addtions and fixes in no peticular
order are (mud names) Alun, Mason and Euphrates. There are several others
that also made addtions to the world but as of this typing I cannot remember
them all :)


Version 4.0

	Is not released as I plan to be one version ahead of the rest of the
world... Version 3.0 was released when we began running 4.0. Let it be noted
that the mud docs need severe RE-WRITTING but I simply do not have time.
Someday it might get done. I suggest using 'wizhelp' to figure out the
immortal commands as I think we have added all of them there.
