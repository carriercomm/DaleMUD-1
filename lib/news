+ Other teachers are throughout the land, seek the Loremaster to learn
  languages, the archer to learn to spot your quarry, the hunter to learn
  his skills and the fabled ninja master.

+ ANY PC killing will be dealt with harshly. I do NOT like the thought of
  people just killing to kill so I have removed PKILL, period. You do it
  you get drained, if you are level one, you get froze. No excuses.
