	Lets please get all areas on SD2 done as quickly and as best as
possible. Lets also try and crush any bugs in the new code. We will be
allowing mortal testing now and then, so be SURE to bring yours in. Remember
as gods you can test mortals at ANY time.

	Make a note we have re-organized the commands and at what level you
get them. BE sure to ask higher gods about commands you might have lost.
Some of you will GAIN new commands. All this pertains to SD2 only.
