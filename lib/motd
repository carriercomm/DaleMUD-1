	The New SD code will be coming in soon. During the convertion we
	will be in a testing period that will continue until we feel things
	are working smoothly. The testing period will mean that some major
	changes to classes or skills or your character itself might be
	altered. As with all new changes there will be problems so be
	understanding when a problem occures. If you note a specific problem
	please use mud mail and report them to your favorite immort.

	Please hold off on all questions on the new code until it arrives.
