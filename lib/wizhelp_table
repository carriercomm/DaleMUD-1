"ROOM TELEPORT"
 
some new things for teleport rooms:
 
 
edit tele <time> <room> <flags> [<countdown>]
 
flags = 
1     LOOK    (do a look when you get teleported
2     COUNT   (this is a countdown room)
4     RANDOM  (after the first teleport, this room will teleport in random
		time)
8     SPIN    (Not implemented yet)
 
 
Some things to note:
 
 if you are going to set the COUNT flag, then leave the <time> = 0
 
 COUNT, RANDOM and SPIN are more or less mutually exclusive.
 
 
examples
 
   edit tele 30 1000 1       ;  teleport fires every 30 ticks, goes to room
			        1000, does a look
 
   edit tele  0 1000 3 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and
				they will do a look.
 
   edit tele  0 1000 2 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and they
				will NOT do a look
 
Any questions, post them on the board
 
The random time will be between 10 and 100 ticks
 
(so roughly between 7.5 seconds and 75 seconds)
 
Note, this is a god command, mortals can't do it.

EDIT
   Edit allows you to edit rooms.  The room you are currently in is
the one that is edited.  You can edit any room, but the changes will
not be permanent.  However, using the rsave, and rload commands, you
can save your changes into a file, and reload them later into the
game, (if it crashes, for example).
 
The fields work as follows:
 
 edit <field> <attributes>
 
   field is one of the following:
 
	name     :  changes the name of the room.
	desc     :  changes the room description.
	exit     :  adds, deletes or modifies a room's exits
	fs       :  changes the Flags, and Sector type.
	exdsc    :  adds, changes or deletes an exit description
	extra    :  adds an extra description to a room.
	riv      :  adds special parameters for rivers.
	tele     :  makes the room a teleport room.
        tunn     :  makes the room a tunnel room.
 
   attributes:
 
	name  <name of room>
	desc  <enter>  (it will prompt you for text)
	exit  <dir> <door flags> <key> <to_room> [<open command>]
	fs    <flags> <sector_type>
	exdsc <dir> <enter>  (prompts you for text)
	extra <keywords> <enter>  (prompts you for text)
	riv   <speed> <dir>
        tele  <time> <to_room> <look-flag>
        tunn  <mob_lim>
 
<dir>  0 = n, 1 = e, 2 = s, 3 = w, 4 = u, 5= d.
<door flags> 
        'S' - secret flag
        'C' - climb
        'P' - pickproof
        'D' - is_door
        "edit exit 0 2s 23 blah-blah"
        and SECRET|IS_DOOR|PICKPROOF exit will be created
 
<key> item # that opens door, (if no door, use -1)
<to_room>  The room # that the exit goes to.
		* Optional command
[<open command>] Command to open this exit 
		(pull=224, twist=371, turn=372 lift=373, push=374)

<time> The time interval between teleports.  Must be a multiple of 10

            if this number is 0, they won't know they've been teleported
            unless they look on their own.  if the number is not 0, each 
            time they are teleported, they are forced to look.
 
<keywords> which things will trigger info.. for example if the keyword is
	case
	then if you type look at case, the text will be displayed.
 
<speed>  must be a multiple of 15. if you do not want the river to flow, 
	speed should be 0.  
 
<mob_lim>  A number, indicating the number of mobiles that can be in the
           room at one time.  The TUNNEL roomflag must be set, although
